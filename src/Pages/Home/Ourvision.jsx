                    We strive to create an inclusive community who accepts others for who they are and
                    encourages them to grow bigger than they imagine themselves to be. This happens through:
                    engaging in meaningful dialogue both in and out of the NFT space, giving to those who are truly
                    ready to receive and equipping others to become leaders themselves in the NFT space and
                    outside of it.
